 Decentralized Book (DBook)

A DApp to store and manage database of missing people in a country or city using blockchain technology.

I developed this DApp for 'Missing Hackathon' conducted in HackerEarth online in 2019. And I am glad to share that my dapp passed through 2 rounds out of the 3 rounds in the Hackathon.

Built this smart contract using Remix IDE->developed the webpages->Integrated smart contract & webpages->Executed on Ethereum test network
